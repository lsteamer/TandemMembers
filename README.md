# TandemMembers

TandemMembers is a challenge for Tandem, showing a list of dummy users.

## First impressions of the Challenge

The first thing that stood out as being different than other challenges, is the fact that it's requesting to get data from an n number of pages, the last page being with less than 20 objects.

While I never used pagination, I think it will be the thing that will be needed. 

## App is almost ready, Testing and overall polish missing.

On the last two commits I managed to add Paging successfully and it fits exactly with what the challenge was requesting. 
At the moment, I'm unsure how or what to test since the app is relatively empty and frankly I'm not familiar enough with Paging to write effective tests. 

## Sending the email, branch for testing is WIP

I started work on a branch dedicated to testing, with more time I'm confident I would have found a way to write relevant and solid Unit tests. At the moment in regards to testing, there's only the structure, I might write something tomorrow if I find some inspiration (the time limit is still in 12 hours).

Including an APK.

Regardless of which direction we end up moving to, I believe that my app meets the requirements and I hope to receive good concise feedback in regards to my code.

Icon for the app comes from the [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/term/languages/2711986/). I modified it a bit to add more color

For the Paging I followed the [codelabs for paging](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-paging) which was simple to follow.
